Here's a simple command you can run in Command Prompt:\n\n```cmd\ndir\n```\n\nThis will list all the files and directories in the current directory. If you want detailed information about each file, you can use:\n\n```cmd\ndir /q\n```\n\nThis command will display file ownership in addition to the usual details [ss64.com](https://ss64.com/nt/dir.html).\n\n### For Python:\nIf you are using Python, there are multiple ways to list files in a directory, like using `os.listdir()` or `os.walk()`. Here is an example of using `os.listdir()`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_files_in_directory(directory_path):\n    try:\n        files = os.listdir(directory_path)\n        print(\"Files in directory:\", files)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"The directory does not exist\")\n\nlist_files_in_directory('.')\n```\n\nThis code snippet will print all the files in the current directory [builtin.com](https://builtin.com/data-science/python-list-files-in-directory).\n\n#### Note:\nFor practical execution, I can run a shell command in your current directory. Please let me know if you'd like me to proceed with this.",
